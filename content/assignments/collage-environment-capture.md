title: Collage Environment Capture Mini-Project
---

Go into a room and capture it with photographs. Take wide panoramic shots, close-up shots of important things, texture shots, detail shots, etc.

What's important about the space? Is it how it's used? It's verbs? It's motions? It's lighting? The details?

Collage these photographs together (not constrained by the rules of perspective) into a collage that represents the space's visuals.

You can use any software for the collage, even Word. Photoshop is recommended, but will not be lectured with during the course.

You should have at least 10 images, and they should be cropped and placed meaningfully in the collage.

## Purpose
This assignment is, if anything, the *opposite* of the lecture during the week. This is the point - in VR we will get to practical applications of the theories.

Looking at the world through a viewfinder, projecting onto 2D (photography) is a great way to learn about perspective and perception.

When creating spaces, we have goals beyond reconstructing depth. We must do it with purpose, manipulating all elements to focus on what we want.
This assignment is that *part* of a design process, ("Showing the parts that matter"), but isolated from the challenges of practically doing it in 3D.

Next, we will do it again, basically, but in 3D and with a critical eye to perspective and depth signifiers.
