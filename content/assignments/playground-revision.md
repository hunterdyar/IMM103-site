title: Playground Revision
order: 3
---
This assignment will is the same as Unity Playground, with a catch.

You are going to improve, revise, or redesign a space originally chosen by a *different student*.

Your new project will be assigned randomly.

You will be starting again from scratch, although you can connect with the student you have been assigned for any of the assets that they used. You also need to credit them in your project, of course.

### Purpose
- Applying knowledge of perception lecture to a project.
- Critically thinking about how spaces are perceived while designing them.
- Practice in Unity.
- Practice sharing and moving assets around.
- Practice working with projects that have complex or foreign file structures.
- Practice creating environments in 3D.
- Engagement in an analytical and iterative creative workflow.

### Submission
Like before, submit a screenshot of the project, but you also must include the readme.txt file that answers the following questions:

1. What space did you start with?
2. What did you change?
3. How did you utilize how we perceive spaces to better "sell" your space as a 3D environment?

This readme should also include your name, the class title/section, and credits to any assets used. See the syllabus for more information on readme requirements.
